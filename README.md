Node Typescript Express Template
================================

Project template for using NodeJS with the Express Framework and TypeScript code to create a web application.


Developer Application Requirements
----------------------------------
Install these globally using the following command:

````
npm install -g bower express typescript tsd nodemon gulp node-inspector
````

### Compile Everything
First obtain all external references, packages & type definitions by running the following command:

````
npm install
````

This will (1) download all NPM packages referenced in the project, (2) download all bower packages and (3) download all TypeScript type definitions. Steps 2 & 3 are done after `npm install` completes as dictated by a script in the `package.json` file. You can run them manually using `bower install` and `tsd reinstall` if you wanted.

Compile the TypeScript, used in Node.js application, by running the following command from within the root of the application:

````
gulp compile-ts
````

You can remove all compiled JavaScript and source maps by running the following:

````
gulp clean-ts
````

When developing you can run the following. This will monitor any changes to TypeScript and handlebars files (used as the MVC view engine in the Node.js application). If any changes are detected it will automatically do the following things:

- **Lint all TypeScript** (gulp task **lint-ts**)
    - This will check all TypeScript to ensure it meets the coding style rules defined in the [tslint.json](tslint.json) file.
- **Update TypeScript references** (gulp task **gen-server-tsrefs**)
    - There are three files referenced at the top of every TypeScript file. 
    - The first, **typings/tsd.d.ts**, contains references to all TypeScript type definition files obtained using the tool [tsd.exe](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd). 
    - The other file that's referenced is **typings/server.d.ts**... it references the TypeScript files used within the application. 
    - This saves the developer from adding all these references to each and every file in the project. 
- **Compile all TypeScript** (gulp task **compile-server-ts**) 
    - This compiles all the TypeScript to JavaScript.
